full stack financial tracker using chatgpt

using node.js, ejs, alpine.js, chart.js

npm run dev --> run server even while saving/updating --> live updates
npm run start --> need to kill and rerun to see changes

Need to make dashboard look nice, set up database and data, get user/user id stuff working --> check apps.js for comment

Also need to get chart stuff working too


From Chat:
Hook this into SQLite or PostgreSQL?

âœ… Build a real dashboard with charts and transaction data?
